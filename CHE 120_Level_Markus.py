#create a matrix to position the map tiles!
#MP: As the group member in charge of designing the more difficult of the two mazes, I investigated what size matrix would be needed
#MP: as the base of an appropriately sized level, capable of an appropriatelt complex design without devolving into unnecessary convolusion.
#MP: A 25 by 25 grid was an appropriate scale to encompass the maze. In order to include an outer wall, this was expanded to 27 by 27.

#MP: In addition to designing the matrix, the matrix_columns and matrix_rows variables were adjusted to allow the game's code to function on a level of the chosen size.

#MP: The matrix which serves to define most of the maze's physical structure utilizes the following elements:
#MP: matrix[][] == 0 indicates a tile (square) of the maze which is permanently impassable, acting as the maze's walls. 
#MP: This is accomplished using the key specifications within the blockCollision() function, as defined below
#MP: matrix[][] == 1 indicates a tile which is permanently passable, acting as the maze's corridors
#MP: matrix[][] > 1  indicates a door, which is a tile which is conditionally passable, based on whether the player has last picked up the related key.
#MP: The door and key are defined by the makeDoor() and makeKey() functions respectively, each defined and implemented below 
#MP: matrix[][] == -1 indicates the goal of the maze. This tile is initially described in the blockCollision() functionas defined below.
